# To use this shell, type in bash commands and their respective commands will execute. Entering "quit" will exit the shell.
# To do redirect I/O, either run ./myshell < input or [>/>>] output or combine the two.
# Redirect I/O allows you to take input commands from a file instead of user input and outputs it to an output file.
